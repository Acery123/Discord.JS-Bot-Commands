# Discord.JS Bot Commands
## Status 
> Incomplete
## What is this repo about?
This contains a wide range of commands and snippets that will aid you in your discord bot development 
> The code is written in JavaScript

## Is there a command hander?
As of today, no. I have plans on adding a command handler but that's for the future.

## Can I just copy paste the commands?
Maybe, some commands yeah, some commands no. 
It is **not** recommended to just copy paste code without having an understanding about what they do, I will have doc and guide links and will try to explain the code for you.

## Guide:
Commands are split into categories and features.
Example: If you want to look for a `Lockdown` command, you'll have to check the `Channel Related` folder.

### Why?
I'm just making it for fun and with hopes of inspiring or helping out people who are creating a discord bot

### Road Map

- Add a `Channel Info` command 
- Add the `channelUpdate` event
- Add `Fun Related` commands
- Add `Meme Related` commands
- Add `Logging Related Setup` commands
- Add `Logging Related Events` events
- Add a `Customizable Ticket System`
- Add more commands to `User Related`
