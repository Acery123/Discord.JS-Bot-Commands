# Guide
- GBF Commands Source Code under [GBF](https://github.com/DepressedBunnys/Discord.JS-Bot-Commands/tree/main/GBF)
➜ This contains GBF's Source Code, the exact code used for GBF with no notes explaning what it does, contains the actual file that runs in GBF and seperate commands since they're all under one sub-command
#
- GBF Handler Updated under [GBF Handler](https://github.com/DepressedBunnys/Discord.JS-Bot-Commands/tree/main/GBF%20Handler)
➜ This is the new handler that GBF v2.5.0 will be using, the handler is feature rich and supports Legacy & Slash Commmands, the current handler that GBF uses is still private but there is a high chance it will be released **but** it will have **no support**
# 
- GBF Commands under [Seperated Commands](https://github.com/DepressedBunnys/Discord.JS-Bot-Commands/tree/main/Separated%20Commands)
➜ These are GBF's commands updated and explained, when getting code it's recommended to get it from here, this contains all of GBF's commands but they're updated to be easily added to your project and there's notes explaining everything going on

## More Information will be added here once available
