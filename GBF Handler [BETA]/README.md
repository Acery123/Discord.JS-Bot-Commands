# GBF Handler [BETA]
This is the super early version of the public `GBF Handler` 

## Information
Once completed, the private and public version will be released
The commands folder will not contain many commands but will contain just examples to test

## How to run:
The index.js that is **outside** of the `folders` is what we use to run the bot.
The `handler` folder contains `utils` and the handler `source code` [src]
You need to import the handler as shown in the main index.js file and run the handler as shown again
